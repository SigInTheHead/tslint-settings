tslint configuration.

These are my personal preferences, and were created to save me copy and pasting my `tslint.json` to each new project.

#Installation
`npm install -D tmo-tslint-settings`

# Usage
In the `tslint.json` file update the extends property to 
```json
{
  "extends": ["tmo-tslint-settings"],
}
```

I personally have the above as the entire contents on my `tslint.json`
